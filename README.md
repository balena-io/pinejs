# Pine.js

Pine.js is a sophisticated rules-driven API engine that enables you to define rules in a structured subset of English. Those rules are used in order for Pine.js to generate a database schema and the associated [OData](http://www.odata.org/) API. This makes it very easy to rapidly create, update and maintain a backend while keeping the logic in an easily understood form, as well as providing the ability to update and maintain this logic going forward.

Rules are described in *SBVR* format, which stands for "Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules". SBVR provides a way to capture specifications in natural language and represent them in formal logic, so they can be machine processed. See [docs/SBVR.md](docs/SBVR.md) for an explanation of how Pine understands SBVR.

In order to get an idea of how SBVR works, visit the [sbvr lab](http://www.sbvr.co/), and for more details, check out the [SBVR spec](http://www.omg.org/spec/SBVR/).

The following tools demonstrate the way to use the compile chain from a SBVR file to SQL and from an OData URL to SQL:

* [https://github.com/resin-io-modules/sbvr-compiler](https://github.com/resin-io-modules/sbvr-compiler)
* [https://github.com/resin-io-modules/odata-compiler](https://github.com/resin-io-modules/odata-compiler)

Both tools use some of the main dependencies of Pine.js:

* abstract-sql-compiler
* lf-to-abstract-sql
* sbvr-parser
* odata-parser
* odata-to-abstract-sql

The above packages are written in `OMeta` and compiled into Javascript. The following resources consitute a good starting point in order for someone to get a better understanding of OMeta and the above dependencies:

* [OMeta paper](http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth/papers/dls07.pdf)
* [OMeta slides](http://www.tinlizzie.org/ometa/dls07-slides.pdf)
* [Introduction to OMeta-js](http://b-studios.de/ometa-js/)
* [OMeta workspace](http://tinlizzie.org/ometa-js/#OMeta_Tutorial)
* [Related blog posts](http://codeofrob.com/entries/ometa-odata-odear---polishing-it-off.html)

The following papers are also helpful in understanding the main concept of Pine.js:

* [An SBVR to SQL Compiler](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-649/paper7.pdf)
* [Generating SQL Queries from SBVR Rules](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-16289-3_12)

The documentation inside /docs folder also provide a great overview of the main concepts of Pine.js, in particular:

* [docs/Migrations.md](docs/Migrations.md): provides information regarding sql queries or Javascript functions that are executed prior to pinejs executing a given SBVR model.
* [docs/Hooks.md](docs/Hooks.md): functions that you can implement in order to execute custom code when API calls are requested.
* [docs/ProjectConfig.md](docs/ProjectConfig.md): provides information regarding creating and configuring a project.
* [docs/Types.md](docs/Types.md): types definitions and declarations in various systems.
* [docs/sequence-diagrams/](docs/sequence-diagrams): provide a great overview of how the main processes are executed, including OData request parsing, response processing, etc. (The sequence diagrams can be depicted in [websequencediagrams.com](https://www.websequencediagrams.com))

One can experiment with Pine.js, its main dependencies and the above tools inside the development environment of resin.
