# Type System

## Definition

The SBVR definition for types can be found at [resin-io-modules/sbvr-types/Type.sbvr](https://github.com/resin-io-modules/sbvr-types/blob/master/Type.sbvr)

"The Rest" can be found at: [resin-io-modules/sbvr-types/src/types](https://github.com/resin-io-modules/sbvr-types/tree/master/src/types)

For a new type you should add a module to the types folder. The module should return a single object, which has the following format:

#### types
A types object, which specifies how the type is declared in various systems. This contains:

* postgres/mysql/websql - These can either be a string (which will have the necessity and index appended to it), or a function (necessity, index), which returns the type as a string.

```coffee-script
postgres: 'Serial'
mysql: (necessity, index) ->
	return 'INTEGER' + necessity + index + ' AUTO_INCREMENT'
websql: (necessity, index) ->
	return 'INTEGER' + necessity + index + ' AUTOINCREMENT'
```
* odata - This is an object that must contain a "name" property, which is a string specifying the name of the OData type. It may also contain a "complexType" property, which is a string that specifies an OData ComplexType

```coffee-script
odata:
	name: 'Edm.Int64'
```
```coffee-script
odata:
	name: 'Self.Color'
	complexType: '''
		<ComplexType Name="Color">
			 <Property Name="r" Nullable="false" Type="Edm.Int8"/>\
			 <Property Name="g" Nullable="false" Type="Edm.Int8"/>\
			 <Property Name="b" Nullable="false" Type="Edm.Int8"/>\
			 <Property Name="a" Nullable="false" Type="Edm.Int8"/>\
		</ComplexType>'''
```

* validate - This is a function (value, required, callback(err, data)) that must be provided, and which should validate that incoming data is valid for this type.
	* `value` is the value that has been received as part of the request.
	* `required` specifies whether this value is required (true: NOT NULL, false: NULL).  
	* `callback` should be called with the first parameter as an error explaining why the data is invalid, or if it valid, null, with the second parameter being the valid, processed data.

An example of validating a `Color` type, we accept either a number that specifies the `Color`, or an object {'r' or 'red', 'g' or 'green', 'b' or 'blue', 'a' or 'alpha'}, and return an integer that represents the `Color`.

```coffee-script
validate: (value, required, callback) ->
	if !_.isObject(value)
		processedValue = parseInt(value, 10)
		if _.isNaN(processedValue)
			callback('is neither an integer or color object: ' + value)
			return
	else
		processedValue = 0
		for own component, componentValue of value
			if _.isNaN(componentValue) or componentValue > 255
				callback('has invalid component value of ' + componentValue + ' for component ' + component)
				return
			switch component.toLowerCase()
				when 'r', 'red'
					processedValue |= componentValue >> 16
				when 'g', 'green'
					processedValue |= componentValue >> 8
				when 'b', 'blue'
					processedValue |= componentValue
				when 'a', 'alpha'
					processedValue |= componentValue >> 24
				else
					callback('has an unknown component: ' + component)
					return
	callback(null, processedValue)
```

* fetchProcessing - This is a function (data, callback(err, data)) that may be specified to process the data after fetching from the database and before sending to the client. If specified this function should call the callback passing either an error message as the first param, or null as the first param and the modified data as the second.

```coffee-script
fetchProcessing: (data, callback) ->
	callback(null,
		r: (data >> 16) & 0xFF
		g: (data >> 8) & 0xFF
		b: data & 0xFF
		a: (data >> 24) & 0xFF
	)
```

* nativeProperties - This is an object that may be specified to define "native" properties of the type.  
If specified it should match the format:

```coffee-script
nativeProperties:
	Verb:
		Term: (from) -> ...
		Term2: (from) -> ...
	Verb2:
		Term3: (from) -> ...
```

The `(from) -> ...` function should return a chunk of abstract sql that can be used to fetch the property specified by this fact type, the `from` parameter is abstract sql that will refer to an instance of the term that is of this type.

Text has Length:

```coffee-script
	nativeProperties:
		'has':
			'Length': (from) -> ['CharacterLength', from]
```

For the various properties of Color:

```coffee-script
nativeProperties:
	'has':
		'Red Component': (from) -> ['BitwiseAnd', ['BitwiseShiftRight', from, 16], 255]
		'Green Component': (from) -> ['BitwiseAnd', ['BitwiseShiftRight', from, 8], 255]
		'Blue Component': (from) -> ['BitwiseShiftRight', from, 255]
		'Alpha Component': (from) -> ['BitwiseAnd', ['BitwiseShiftRight', from, 24], 255]
```

* nativeFactTypes - This is an object that may be specified to define "native" fact types of the type. If specified it should match the format:

```coffee-script
nativeFactTypes:
	'Term':
		'Verb1': (from, to) -> ...
		'Verb2': (from, to) -> ...
	'Term2':
		'Verb3': (from, to) -> ...
```

The `(from, to) -> ...` function should return a chunk of abstract sql that can be used to resolve this fact type.  
The `from` parameter is abstract sql that will refer to an instance of the term that is of this type.  
The `to`  parameter is abstract sql that will refer to an instance of the term that is of the type specified by the property name.  

Note: The reasoning the ordering of this is `SecondTerm -> Verb`, rather than `Verb -> SecondTerm` is that it allows declaring all the links between two terms much easier (as you will see in the examples)

A selection of the the native fact types for Integer (in the actual file much more DRY is practiced):

```coffee-script
nativeFactTypes:
	'Integer':
		'is greater than': (from, to) -> ['GreaterThan', from, to]
		'is greater than or equal to': (from, to) -> ['GreaterThanOrEqual', from, to]
		'is less than': (from, to) -> ['LessThan', from, to]
		'is less than or equal to': (from, to) -> ['LessThanOrEqual', from, to]
	'Real':
		'is greater than': (from, to) -> ['GreaterThan', from, to]
		'is greater than or equal to': (from, to) -> ['GreaterThanOrEqual', from, to]
		'is less than': (from, to) -> ['LessThan', from, to]
		'is less than or equal to': (from, to) -> ['LessThanOrEqual', from, to]
```
