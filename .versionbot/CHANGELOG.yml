      hash: b5d51b27fa6bfa6e38093a00ba7ecfb21db38520
      body: |
        This allows freeing up all the memory used by the abstractSqlQuery tree
        once the sqlQuery has been generated at the cost that the
        abstractSqlQuery cannot be recompiled for another db engines. In
        practice this shouldn't be a limitation as using multiple db engines
        with a single model is not supported and unlikely to work.

    - subject: Fix missing required validation on bindings
      hash: 5eac96faefde83ce9d1964b407cf6a490df83920
      body: |
        In previous commit `bdb34d` the code path for `getAndCheckBindValues` was simplified
        considering the declared type of `{dataType: string}`. That typing is not complete and thus the simplification was wrong.

        The field property may also contain a `required` property which is used for doing oData validation (from sbvr-types)
        In that simplification we excluded the required information for bound variables: https://github.com/balena-io/pinejs/commit/bdb34d9df39e0d9d00db492cbb1ef6dfc61e8450#diff-abade937407ef92d95cd36b5719e481229475da7d3f8bdc613bebef8971c35d2R107

        This reverts back the code simplification but keeping the necessary changes for List binding type.

                                                The internal and external
                                                representation of the returned
                                                object from pinejs should be
                                                consistent.

                                                Pinejs internal interface will
                                                return date or date time fields
                                                as date object. For the external
                                                interface the object is
                                                JSON.stringified so that date
                                                becomes an ISO string anyway.

                                        Return big integer values as strings
                                        instead of bigint as we need to

                                        parse them back into strings anyway when
                                        returning data from pine. The

                                        new logic and types closely follow the
                                        same pattern we have for dates.

        This is necessary because the `fromAbstractSqlModel` (here renamed to
        translationAbstractSqlModel)

        will actually contain both the unaliased fromResource and aliased
        toResource where the previous

        approach of passing only `toResource` might not contain the aliased
        toResource

                                                representation of the returned

                                                consistent.

                                                Pinejs internal interface will
                                                return date or date time fields
                                                as date object. For the external
                                                interface the object is
                                                JSON.stringified so that date
                                                becomes an ISO string anyway.

                                        instead of bigint as we need to

                                        parse them back into strings anyway when
                                        returning data from pine. The

                                        new logic and types closely follow the
                                        same pattern we have for dates.

                                parse them back into strings anyway when
                                returning data from pine. The

                                new logic and types closely follow the same
                                pattern we have for dates.

                                        The internal and external representation
                                        of the returned object from pinejs
                                        should be consistent.

                                        Pinejs internal interface will return
                                        date or date time fields as date object.
                                        For the external interface the object is
                                        JSON.stringified so that date becomes an
                                        ISO string anyway.

                                                The internal and external
                                                representation of the returned
                                                object from pinejs should be
                                                consistent.

                                                Pinejs internal interface will
                                                return date or date time fields
                                                as date object. For the external
                                                interface the object is
                                                JSON.stringified so that date
                                                becomes an ISO string anyway.

                        Return big integer values as strings instead of bigint
                        as we need to

                        parse them back into strings anyway when returning data
                        from pine. The

                        new logic and types closely follow the same pattern we
                        have for dates.

                                The internal and external representation of the
                                returned object from pinejs should be
                                consistent.

                                Pinejs internal interface will return date or
                                date time fields as date object. For the
                                external interface the object is
                                JSON.stringified so that date becomes an ISO
                                string anyway.

                                        The internal and external representation
                                        of the returned object from pinejs
                                        should be consistent.

                                        Pinejs internal interface will return
                                        date or date time fields as date object.
                                        For the external interface the object is
                                        JSON.stringified so that date becomes an
                                        ISO string anyway.

                        Return big integer values as strings instead of bigint
                        as we need to

                        parse them back into strings anyway when returning data
                        from pine. The

                        new logic and types closely follow the same pattern we
                        have for dates.

                                        The internal and external representation
                                        of the returned object from pinejs
                                        should be consistent.

                                        Pinejs internal interface will return
                                        date or date time fields as date object.
                                        For the external interface the object is
                                        JSON.stringified so that date becomes an
                                        ISO string anyway.

                                Pinejs internal interface will return date or
                                date time fields as date object. For the

                                JSON.stringified so that date becomes an ISO
                                string anyway.

                This requires passing the model typings when creating the
                pinejs-client

                instance and will mean that any usage after that will be type
                checked

                to limit to resources/properties that exist on the model. This
                covers

                almost all usage but there are some cases we cannot cover as we
                would

                need typescript support for partial inference of generics, eg
                for

                lambdas, or to make major changes to the querying interface.

                This work should also be fully backwards compatible such that if
                you do

                not provide model typings then all typings should continue to
                work as

                previously

                The intention is that these are use as helpers functions to
                build the

                url from an object and so passing a `url` directly is not really
                the

                intent and interferes with improving the typings for the
                intended case.

                It is still possible to pass urls directly to the `request`
                function if

                it is essential but the true answer is to support building those
                urls,

                and using `prepare` if it is necessary

                This is because they are not designed to support using a `url`
                and are

                likely to break in very weird and unexpected ways, and as such
                removing

                it from the typing should reduce potential for surprising errors

                This uses the typescript types exported from @balena/sbvr-types
                so that

                new types can be dynamically picked up and the types we expose
                will

                match those that sbvr-types expects, avoiding any potential
                issues if

                our hardcoded types were to diverge from the types sbvr-types
                actually

                expects

                This allows easily choosing read vs write types with just one
                set of

                types with no need to generate/manage two separate sets of
                typings. It

                also allows these typings to be passed as generics to other
                functions

                and they will also be able to distinguish read vs write

                        The internal and external representation of the returned
                        object from pinejs should be consistent.

                        Pinejs internal interface will return date or date time
                        fields as date object. For the external interface the
                        object is JSON.stringified so that date becomes an ISO
                        string anyway.

    - subject: Update `@balena/sbvr-types` to enable ISODatestring as internal pine
        API interface for date and date time fields.
      hash: f5e8e6ebfd0d3f590ef6ed3fa6b46d1b0861d409
      body: >
        Update `@balena/sbvr-types` from 6.1.1 to 7.0.1


        pinejs provides an internal and external interface. The external
        interface returns ISODateString encoded data.

        The internal interface should be consistent to the external interface,
        so that the pinejs api internally used also returns an ISODateString
        encoded data. This is solved in `sbvr-types` and is a major in the
        submodule and made this also a major change for pinejs itself.

      hash: a66ad6a82ce243fff63e06b2f7729c73cebc6bb2
      body: |
        They were failing because they were expecting translations for the
        versioned copies of resources, eg `resource$v2`, so this just avoids
        those copies and only requires the "true" resources from the model to
        be translated

                        Ensure that the input passed in for JSON types is either
                        an object or

                        an array (typeof returns 'object' for arrays as well).
                        This change is

                        mainly to prevent primitives from being stored as JSON.

        https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/pull/2967


        In pinejs the case is handled and as of now we don't want to populate a
        breaking change by transparently push the types to callers.

        On empty database schemas the `migrations` model is not executed.

        Hence, every model migration that is executed before the `migrations`
        model

        will not be tracked properly. This is an edge case for empty database
        schemas.

                        mainly to prevent primitives from being stored as JSON.

                      hash: 7d4bfac3b0dbcc6f916c90837398aff1e84588bc

                        After every write, pine has to rerun all rules from the
                        model to ensure

                        consistency. These rules run over the entire database,
                        sometimes causing

                        some queries to run for too long against what should be
                        a simple write.


                        This commit adds a mechanism to help with this issue by
                        narrowing the

                        set of rows that each rule should touch to those rows
                        that were actually

                        changed.


                        Implementing this mechanism safely is doable and not
                        necessarily complex

                        code-wise, but requires a deep modifications from the
                        current

                        architecture. This commit adds a restricted form instead
                        where we only

                        narrow the rows of the root table that were changed. If
                        any other table

                        was changed then narrowing is a no op.


                        It can be proved that this is always safe as long as the
                        root table is

                        selected from only once and the rule is positive ("It is
                        necessary that

                        each ...").


                        The implementation here adds a single binding into the
                        rule's SQL query

                        which can be bound by pine for each rule where an
                        opportunity to use

                        this optimization arises.


                        The implementation itself is simple: count how many
                        times the root table

                        is selected from and if it is selected from exactly one,
                        then add a

                        narrowing constraint in the form of:


                        $1 = '{}' OR

                        <root table>.id = ANY(CAST($1 AS INTEGER[]))


                        Where $1 will be bound to either '{}', which disables
                        narrowing, or to a

                        list of IDs that were affected by the write.


                        This initial implementation can be extended in the
                        future.

                This increases the minimum postgres version for AggregateJSON
                from 9.2

                to 9.3 but it is likely that other places already require
                postgres

                >=9.3 and as such this should not increase the minimum version
                at all.

                If it does somehow manage to then increasing the minimum from a
                2012

                postgres to 2013 should still be fine

                isNumericValue is evaluated in arithmetic expressions

                if operands in expression can be used as numericValues.


                In SQL statements arithmetic expressions like add/sub are
                supported for date values.

                DateArithmetic nodes need input dependent typing.

                        In SQL statements arithmetic expressions like add/sub
                        are supported for date values.

                        DateArithmetic nodes need input dependent typing.

        This allows us to make properties on the process odata request required

        as of now this only affects the `engine` property but in future further
        properties of the processed request could be made required. And even at
        this point it will block passing a parsed only request object to a
        function expecting a processed request object

        Modules may need to know if a model existed before initialisation of the
        instance.

        Eg. migrations need to know if a model is freshly generated / executed

        of if this model already existed and can be target for migrations.

      hash: 263d40d3d2fedc03ab639a94255b8b013f86ab7f
      body: >
        When a permission uses the `canAccess()` function to derive access,

        to another resource, we can optimize the generated SQL queries to not,

        reapply the full permission for resources, that are reached by

        expanding or filtering paths. We achieve this by, applying shortcuts

        in the relationships of the abstract sql model, if we find usages of

        an `canAccess()` function in the relevant permissions, that link the

        resources in the correct direction.


        An example:


        Let's imagine a model where a `device` belongs to an `application`.


        We have the following permissions:


        ```

        example.application.get?belongs_to__user/any(u:u/actor eq @__ACTOR_ID)

        example.device.get?belongs_to__application/canAccess()

        ```


        Given the following odata query:

        ```

        GET
        /example/application?$select=id,name&$filter=(owns__device/any(d:d/name
        eq 'test'))&$expand=owns__device($select=id,name)

        ```


        Will not yield the following SQL statement anymore:

        ```

        SELECT (
                SELECT coalesce(array_to_json(array_agg("application.owns-device".*)), '[]') AS "owns__device"
                FROM (
                        SELECT "application.owns-device"."id", "application.owns-device"."name"
                        FROM (
                                SELECT "device"."created at", "device"."id", "device"."belongs to-application", "device"."name"

      hash: 6385f64a59bde65d543f0dd5201f689218bb01b7
      body: |
        Invocation of actor ID lookup by api key is moved upstream,
        so it can be stored on the apiKey object and reused.

        This way, we can use actor ID in both session tokek and api key
        authentication cases without extra DB query.
